# mcp-rust-server

High-performance **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) server for code analysis, security scanning, and project insightsâ€”written in Rust ðŸ¦€.

---

## Related Project

This MCP server exposes the capabilities of the [`syncable-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/syncable-cli) tool to AI agents. While `syncable-cli` is a standalone CLI tool for interacting with Syncable workspaces, this server acts as a bridge, allowing AI agents and other clients to access those CLI features programmatically via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Both projects are closely related and complement each other.

## Features

* **Fast & Scalable**: Built with async Rust on the Tokio runtime
* **Multi-Protocol**: Supports both stdio and SSE (Server-Sent Events) transports
* **Security Scanning**: Static analysis and vulnerability detection
* **Extensible**: Easily add new MCP handlers and custom tools
* **Production-Ready**: Optimized release profile, structured logging, and CI integration

## Installation

rust-mcp-server-syncable-cli is published on [crates.io]. You need a recent Rust toolchain (1.70+ recommended). It works as a MCP server for AI agents where you can use langgraph framework or similar to connect to this MCP server for code scanning. 

### CLI Binaries

```bash
cargo install rust-mcp-server-syncable-cli
```

This installs two binaries into your Cargo `bin` directory (usually `~/.cargo/bin`):

* `mcp-stdio` â€” stdin/stdout-based MCP server
* `mcp-sse`   â€” HTTP/SSE-based MCP server

### Library

Add to your projectâ€™s `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-mcp-server-syncable-cli = "0.1.0"
```

---

## Usage

### CLI Binaries

```bash
# Run the stdio-based server
mcp-stdio

# Run the SSE-based server
mcp-sse
```

By default, both servers will:

1. Read framed MCP requests (JSON-RPC) from the chosen transport
2. Dispatch to your registered handlers
3. Write framed MCP responses

### Library

```rust
use rust_mcp_server_syncable_cli::{start_stdio, start_sse};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Run as a stdio server
    start_stdio().await?;

    // Or run as an HTTP/SSE server
    // start_sse().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

* `start_stdio()` initializes logging, registers tools, and listens on stdin/stdout.
* `start_sse()` spins up an HTTP server at `http://0.0.0.0:8000/mcp` and streams MCP responses.
